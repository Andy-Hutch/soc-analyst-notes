# SOC Analyst Notes – Hands-On Learning

Welcome to my SOC Analyst Notes repository. This repo documents my hands-on learning and practical exercises in Security Operations Center (SOC) operations, alert triage, phishing analysis, ransomware response, SIEM basics, and understanding SOC roles and workflows.

These notes are based on free SOC labs, simulations, and practical exercises aimed at developing the skills of a Junior Security Analyst (SOC L1). The goal is to show my ability to think like a SOC analyst, triage incidents, escalate threats, and understand how teams defend organizations from cyber attacks.
